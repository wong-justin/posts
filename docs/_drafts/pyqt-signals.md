signals in qt ...

custom signals must be declared as class attributes in order to be bound to the instantiated object. something something c++ qt. I understand this was implemented in [PyQt4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/new_style_signals_slots.html)
<!-- old version reference: https://doc.bccnsoft.com/docs/PyQt4/old_style_signals_slots.html -->

<!-- on signal signatures btw, just for fun: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2018-September/040828.html -->

signals are great for multithreaded apps. worker threads can't update gui (pyqt rule), so they should signal the main thread instead.

here's the standard usage:

```python
class TypicalQObject(QObject):
    signal = pyqtSignal()
    # maybe this is a meaningful class that does work, but maybe not

o = TypicalQObject()
o.signal.connect(lambda: print('signal in a typical qobject'))
o.signal.emit()
```

Reasons for the pattern, according to PyQt4 devs:
"New signals defined in this way will be automatically added to the classâ€™s QMetaObject. This means that they will appear in Qt Designer and can be introspected using the QMetaObject API."

-

>>> New signals should only be defined in sub-classes of QObject. They must be part of the class definition and cannot be dynamically added as class attributes after the class has been defined. [source](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/new_style_signals_slots.html)

<!-- interesting note about benefits of decorating a connected function as a pyqtSlot, ven tho i wasn't focused on slots:
Connecting a signal to a decorated Python method also has the advantage of reducing the amount of memory used and is slightly faster. (same source) -->



Reasons against the pattern:
- clumsy and not intuitive; signals make sense as object-level attributes, not forced class attributes.
    - [people](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45620056) [often](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36435321) [define](https://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/eventssignals/) [a](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17483765) class just for holding a signal or [get](https://forum.qt.io/topic/101616/pyside2-qtcore-signal-object-has-no-attribute-emit/10) [confused](https://stackoverflow.com/q/52627074) [that](https://stackoverflow.com/q/37630233) it even needs to be a class attribute in the first place; the behavior is adulterated with c++ implementation, which is probably be a common problem when binding to another language, but extra confusing nonetheless and solveable here.
- not dynamic; not usually a big deal since signaling logic is a design choice before runtime, but still - it's nice to have options beyond hard-coding.
<!-- this guy had some more complaints https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21101500/custom-pyqtsignal-implementation -->
<!-- this guy was extending a qt object that wasn't QObject so he had to have the signal outside https://stackoverflow.com/a/17483765 -->

The core problem is that a signal must belong to a particular ~~object~~ class. Can we just treat signals as independent objects?

## Solution:

#### Dummy classes for holding signals

This is the dynamic alternative to hard-coding a signal in a class definition.

Fun fact: [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) is overloaded beyond the usual `type(object)`. You can dynamically create classes with it!

```python
  dummy_class = type(
      'irrelevant', # class name
      (QObject,),   # base classes
      dict(         # class attributes and methods
          signal=pyqtSignal()
      )
  )

  obj = dummy_class()
  print( type(obj) )
  print( obj.signal )
  # >>> <class '__main.irrelevant'>
  # >>> <bound PYQT_SIGNAL signal of irrelevant object at 0x0378F850>
```

Wrapped in a function:
```python
def create_signal_holder(name):
    # dynamically create a class with a signal and return instantiated
    return type(
        name, # needs unique name
        (QObject,),
        dict(       
            signal=pyqtSignal()
        )
    )()
```

Function demo:
```python
# now we can make a lot
signal_holders = [
    create_signal_holder(str(i))
    for i in range(10)
]
# and use them
for obj in signal_holders:
    s = obj.signal
    s.connect(lambda: print(type(obj)) )
    s.emit()

# >>> <class '__main__.0'>
# >>> <class '__main__.1'>
# >>> ...
# >>> <class '__main__.9'>
```
It would be nice to disregard the objects holding the signals and instead store only the signals themselves, but that doesn't work. I think the objects get garbage collected and it ruins the signals' bindings. Not a big deal, especially as all this will be hidden in the final implementation:

#### Put in a class

```python
class SignalCollection:

    def __getitem__(self, signal_name):
        if getattr(self, signal_name, None) is None:
            setattr(self, signal_name, create_signal_holder(signal_name))
        return getattr(self, signal_name).signal

signals = SignalCollection()
```

Surprisingly short! All custom signal creation and storage is contained in this one dict-like object. Makes a new signal if the given name hasn't been accessed before. No need to worry any more about binding or classes or anything. Get a signal when you need it. Simpler, as it should be.

```python
signals['a'].connect(lambda: print('signal a was implicitly made, and now it has been emitted'))
signals['a'].emit()
```

More useful example, signaling from a thread:

```python
# multithreaded:
app = QApplication([])  # need event loop running for multithread to work

def emit_and_close():
    signals['b'].emit()
    sleep(0.5)  # without this, sometimes app quit early before callback had a chance to execute
    app.quit()

signals['b'].connect(lambda: print('b emitted'))
Thread(target=emit_and_close).start()

sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

#### Re-featuring

A nice feature of signals is the option to emit data during the event. Those data types are defined when creating a signal, eg. `signal = pyqtSignal(int, str)`. So a small edit to make that option possible:

```python
def create_signal_holder(name, *types):
    # any types will be pyqtSignal() args
    return type(
        name,
        (QObject,),
        dict(
            signal=pyqtSignal(*types)
        )
    )()

# eg. create_signal_holder('name', int, str)
```

and reflected in the class:
```python
class SignalCollection:

    def add_signal(self, signal_name, *types):
        setattr(self, signal_name, create_signal_holder(signal_name, *types))

    def __getitem__(self, signal_name):
        if getattr(self, signal_name, None) is None:
            setattr(self, signal_name, create_signal_holder(signal_name))
        # print(getattr(self, signal_name))
        return getattr(self, signal_name).signal
```

Gotta specifically add a signal with data types before retrieving it, but that's ok.
